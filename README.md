# 🌸 Hey there, I’m **Sherin** 👋  

💖 I fell in love with **technology** without even realizing it — one day I just found myself diving deeper and deeper into this magical world, wandering from one place to another, discovering its endless wonders. 🌈✨  

📖 After a whole year in this field, I’ve learned to **master C++ 🔷** and built a solid foundation in programming. That was my first spark. 🔥  

🖤 Then I started searching for what truly feels like *me* in this ocean of possibilities…  

💻 I stumbled upon **Web Development 🌐**, and began my journey with **HTML** & **CSS**.  
But… somewhere along the way, I felt my light dimming. 🌙  

🌟 So I paused. And I listened to my heart.  

And that’s when I realized — my true dream is to create a **machine 🤖** or an **intelligent device** that can save the world, something that carries *my name* and my story. ✨  

🌸 And here I am now — at the beginning of my journey into the mesmerizing world of **Machine Learning 🧠** and **Artificial Intelligence 🤍**.  
Excited. Hopeful. Determined.  
And still chasing my star. 🌟

## 🌙💫 What I Believe  

✨ Every bug is just a misunderstood feature.  
✨ Learning never ends — and that’s the beauty of it.  
✨ Dreams may be far, but with every step, you get closer.
